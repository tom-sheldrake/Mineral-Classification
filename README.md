# Mineral-Classification
Methodology to classify mineral phases using geochemical maps

All instructions for use can be found in the file "User Input - Classification. R"

Keep the original file structure, as explained in "User Input - Classification. R"

The methodology is explained in Sheldrake & Higgins, 2021. Classification, segmentation and correlation of zoned minerals. Computing & Goesciences. (under review - Feb 2021)

Example application is found in Higgins et al., 2021. Quantitative chemical mapping of plagioclase as a tool for the interpretation of volcanic stratigraphy: an example from Saint Kitts, Lesser Antilles. Earth & Planetary Science Letters. (under review - Feb 2021)
